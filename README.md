# About Myself
I am Jiayang (David) Xu, a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. My research ranges of PCA-based Model Order Reduction (MOR) to deep-learning-based simulations of physical systems. 

This repo shares the results for some of my work. It would be my greatest pleasure if you find some of them interesting!
